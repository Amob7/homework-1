# < homework-1 >

In this project we were given a starter code for a website and were responsible to make css and html have better accessiblity.

  - My motivation was to learn how to edit a document to make the code and website a better experience for anyone who could be involved
  - I built this project to test my skills at editing starter code
  - This solved many problems including organizing css so there is a structure, organizing html so there is a structure, and changing colors to fit the needs of the            colorblind
  - I learned a lot in this project. The only way I can cement these teachings into my brain is by actually coding. Everything before this project assigned I needed more       clarity to understand, but now I understand the concepts and lessons that were previously discussed in class
